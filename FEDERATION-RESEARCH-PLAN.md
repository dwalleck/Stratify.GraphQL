# GraphQL Federation Research Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to research and incorporate GraphQL federation standards from the GraphQL Foundation's Composite Schemas Specification into Stratify.GraphQL.

## Objectives
1. Understand the GraphQL Composite Schemas Specification
2. Review current federation RFCs and their implications
3. Align Stratify.GraphQL with emerging federation standards
4. Identify necessary architectural changes and documentation updates

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Standards Research (High Priority)

#### Task 1: Research GraphQL Composite Schemas Specification
- **Source**: https://github.com/graphql/composite-schemas-spec/tree/main/spec
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Core concepts and terminology
  - Schema composition mechanisms
  - Type merging and conflict resolution
  - Distributed execution model
  - Security and authorization models
- **Deliverable**: Detailed summary of specification

#### Task 2: Review Federation RFCs
- **Source**: https://github.com/graphql/composite-schemas-spec/tree/main/rfcs
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Active RFCs and their status
  - Proposed features and changes
  - Community feedback and concerns
  - Implementation timelines
- **Deliverable**: RFC analysis report

### Phase 2: Analysis and Planning (Medium Priority)

#### Task 3: Create Federation Standards Summary
- Synthesize research from Tasks 1 & 2
- Identify key patterns and requirements
- Compare with existing federation solutions (Apollo Federation, Schema Stitching)
- **Deliverable**: FEDERATION-STANDARDS-SUMMARY.md

#### Task 4: Analyze Stratify.GraphQL Architecture
- Review current source generator approach
- Identify compatibility with federation concepts
- Evaluate performance implications
- **Deliverable**: Architecture compatibility assessment

#### Task 5: Document Impact Analysis
- Identify which project documents need updates:
  - PRD.md (Product Requirements)
  - TDD.md (Technical Design)
  - PATTERNS-CATALOG.md
  - API-REFERENCE.md
  - IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md
  - PERFORMANCE-GUIDE.md
- **Deliverable**: Document update checklist

#### Task 6: Implementation Strategy
- Design federation support approach
- Define incremental implementation phases
- Estimate development effort
- **Deliverable**: FEDERATION-IMPLEMENTATION-STRATEGY.md

## Execution Strategy

### Use of Subagents
To expedite research, we'll leverage subagents for parallel processing:

1. **Specification Research Agent**: Deep dive into composite schemas spec
2. **RFC Analysis Agent**: Review and summarize all federation RFCs
3. **Architecture Analysis Agent**: Analyze current codebase for federation readiness

### Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 hours (with parallel subagent execution)
- Phase 2: 1-2 hours (synthesis and planning)
- Total estimated time: 3-5 hours

## Success Criteria
1. Comprehensive understanding of GraphQL federation standards
2. Clear alignment strategy for Stratify.GraphQL
3. Actionable implementation plan
4. Updated documentation reflecting federation approach

## Next Steps
1. Execute Phase 1 research tasks using subagents
2. Synthesize findings into summary documents
3. Update relevant project documentation
4. Create implementation roadmap
