# Stratify.GraphQL Federation Architecture Analysis

## Current Architecture Overview

Stratify.GraphQL uses a source generator-based approach that eliminates runtime reflection through compile-time code generation. This positions it uniquely for implementing GraphQL federation with zero runtime overhead.

## Federation Compatibility Assessment

### Strengths for Federation Implementation

1. **Build-Time Approach**
   - ADR-003 already commits to build-time federation
   - Aligns perfectly with Composite Schemas Spec's emphasis on compile-time validation
   - Source generators can validate federation directives during compilation

2. **Zero Runtime Reflection**
   - Federation directives can be processed at compile-time
   - Query plans can be pre-generated as optimized C# code
   - No runtime schema composition overhead

3. **Performance-First Design**
   - Pre-computed query plans align with `@provides` optimization
   - Direct method invocation for entity resolvers
   - Minimal allocations through object pooling

4. **Type Safety**
   - Compile-time validation of entity keys
   - Type-safe field selection syntax
   - Early detection of federation configuration errors

### Architectural Alignment with Composite Schemas Spec

#### Directive Processing
Current attribute-based approach maps well to federation directives:

```csharp
// Current Stratify.GraphQL pattern
[GraphQLObject]
public class Product { }

// Federation enhancement
[GraphQLObject]
[Key("id")]
[Key("sku")]
public class Product { }
```

#### Source Generator Pipeline
Existing pipeline can be extended for federation:
1. Collect GraphQL types (existing)
2. **NEW**: Process federation directives
3. Build schema model (existing)
4. **NEW**: Validate federation rules
5. **NEW**: Generate entity resolvers
6. Generate code (existing)

#### Query Execution
Current `GraphQLExecutor` can be enhanced with:
- Pre-generated query plans for distributed execution
- Entity resolution strategies
- Field requirement tracking

### Implementation Considerations

#### 1. Directive Attribute Design
```csharp
// Federation directive attributes
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class, AllowMultiple = true)]
public class KeyAttribute : Attribute
{
    public string Fields { get; }
    public KeyAttribute(string fields) => Fields = fields;
}

[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method)]
public class LookupAttribute : Attribute { }

[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Property | AttributeTargets.Method)]
public class ShareableAttribute : Attribute { }
```

#### 2. Entity Resolution Pattern
```csharp
// Generated entity resolver interface
public interface IEntityResolver<T>
{
    ValueTask<T?> ResolveAsync(
        EntityKey key,
        IServiceProvider services,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}

// Generated implementation
public sealed class ProductEntityResolver : IEntityResolver<Product>
{
    // Pre-compiled resolution strategies
    private readonly FrozenDictionary<string, ResolveDelegate> _strategies;
}
```

#### 3. Schema Composition
```csharp
[FederatedSchema]
public partial class Gateway
{
    [FederatedService("UserService", SchemaFile = "../UserService/schema.graphql")]
    [FederatedService("ProductService", SchemaFile = "../ProductService/schema.graphql")]
    public void ConfigureServices() { }
}
```

### Gaps and Enhancements Needed

1. **Schema File Processing**
   - Need to parse external schema files during source generation
   - Validate schema compatibility at compile-time

2. **Federation Metadata**
   - Extend type model to include federation directives
   - Add validation rules for directive usage

3. **Query Planning**
   - Generate static query plans for common patterns
   - Implement `@provides` optimization strategies

4. **Entity Resolution Framework**
   - Create base classes for entity resolvers
   - Generate efficient lookup implementations

## Competitive Advantages

1. **First Compile-Time Federation**
   - No existing GraphQL library offers compile-time federation
   - Unique selling point for performance-conscious teams

2. **Standards Compliance**
   - Early adoption of GraphQL Foundation standards
   - Future-proof architecture

3. **Zero-Overhead Abstraction**
   - Federation "compiled away" like other patterns
   - No runtime performance penalty

4. **Superior Developer Experience**
   - Compile-time validation catches federation errors early
   - Generated code is debuggable
   - Type-safe throughout

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Federation (4-6 weeks)
- Implement basic federation directives
- Entity resolution framework
- Simple schema composition

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (4-6 weeks)
- Field selection syntax
- `@require` and `@provides` support
- Query plan optimization

### Phase 3: Standards Compliance (2-4 weeks)
- Full Composite Schemas Spec compliance
- Comprehensive validation
- Performance optimizations

## Conclusion

Stratify.GraphQL's architecture is exceptionally well-suited for implementing GraphQL federation. The source generator approach provides unique advantages that align perfectly with the Composite Schemas Specification's goals of compile-time validation, performance, and developer experience.
