### Phase 2: Production Features (4-6 weeks)

**Goal**: Add essential features for production use

#### Weeks 9-10: Mutations & Input Types

- [ ] Batch loading support
- [ ] Query complexity analysis
- [ ] Memory pooling
- [ ] Response caching

#### Weeks 13-14: Developer Experience

- [ ] Hot reload support
- [ ] Enhanced error messages
- [ ] Introspection support
- [ ] Authorization attributes
- [ ] Custom directives

**Production Deliverables**:

- Full CRUD operations support
- N+1 query prevention
- Production-ready performance
- Security features

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (4-6 weeks)

**Goal**: Differentiate with advanced capabilities

#### Weeks 15-16: Type System Completion

- [ ] Interface types
- [ ] Union types
- [ ] Enum types
- [ ] Custom scalar types
- [ ] List types

#### Weeks 17-18: Federation

- [ ] Build-time schema composition
- [ ] Service client generation
- [ ] Query planning
- [ ] Cross-service type resolution

#### Weeks 19-20: Observability & Tools

- [ ] OpenTelemetry integration
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Migration tools from HotChocolate
- [ ] VS Code extension

**Advanced Deliverables**:

- Complete GraphQL type system
- Federation support
- Production monitoring
- Developer tooling

### Phase 4: Ecosystem & Polish (Ongoing)

**Goal**: Build community and refine based on feedback

- [ ] Subscription support (WebSockets)
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Schema versioning
- [ ] Plugin system
- [ ] Community contributions

## Technical Milestones

### Milestone 1: "Hello GraphQL" (Week 4)

```csharp
[GraphQLObject]
public class Query
{
    [GraphQLField]
    public string Hello() => "World";
}
```

- Single query field working
- Source generator producing valid code
- ASP.NET endpoint responding

### Milestone 2: "Real Schema" (Week 8)

```csharp
[GraphQLObject]
public class Book
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    [GraphQLField]
    public async Task<Author> Author([Service] IAuthorService service)
        => await service.GetByIdAsync(AuthorId);
}
```

- Complex types working
- Async resolution
- Service injection
- Performance beating HotChocolate

### Milestone 3: "Production Ready" (Week 14)

- Mutations working
- DataLoader preventing N+1
- Authorization integrated
- 100+ field schema performing well

### Milestone 4: "Federation" (Week 18)

- Multiple services composed
- Cross-service queries working
- Type conflicts resolved
- Performance maintained

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code
- C# Dev Kit (for VS Code)
- BenchmarkDotNet (for performance testing)

## Key Implementation Decisions

### Source Generator Architecture

- Use Incremental Generators for performance
- Generate partial classes for user types
- Emit readable code with #line directives

### Performance Optimizations

- Switch expressions for field resolution
- Object pooling for contexts
- Frozen collections for static data
- Span-based string operations

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for generators (snapshot testing)
- Integration tests for runtime
- Benchmark tests for performance
- E2E tests for full scenarios

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Source generator limitations**: Prototype early, have fallbacks
2. **AOT compatibility**: Test with AOT from day one
3. **Performance targets**: Continuous benchmarking

### Schedule Risks

1. **Scope creep**: Strict MVP definition
2. **Complex features**: Time-box research spikes
3. **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies

## Success Criteria

### MVP Success

- [ ] 50% faster cold start than HotChocolate
- [ ] Zero runtime reflection
- [ ] Working sample application
- [ ] Positive initial feedback

### Production Success

- [ ] 5+ production deployments
- [ ] 1000+ GitHub stars
- [ ] Active community contributions
- [ ] Performance leadership maintained

## Next Steps

1. Set up repository structure
2. Create initial source generator project
3. Implement basic attribute detection
4. Generate first resolver method
5. Celebrate small wins!
