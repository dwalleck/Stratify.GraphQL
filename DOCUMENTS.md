# Stratify.GraphQL - Document Structure Recommendations

Based on the extensive content in your GraphQL API Options document, here's a recommended document structure to properly organize all the information:

## Core Documents (Already Created)

1. **PRD.md** - Product Requirements Document
2. **TDD.md** - Technical Design Document

## Recommended Additional Documents

### 1. **ADR/** (Architecture Decision Records)

Individual files for key decisions:

- `ADR-001-source-generators.md` - Why source generators over reflection
- `ADR-002-graphql-parser.md` - Using GraphQLParser vs custom parser
- `ADR-003-federation-approach.md` - Build-time vs runtime federation
- `ADR-004-aot-tradeoffs.md` - AOT compatibility decisions
- `ADR-005-performance-patterns.md` - Key performance design choices

### 2. **IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md**

Practical development roadmap including:

- Phase-by-phase implementation plan
- MVP scope and timeline (6-8 weeks)
- Feature development priorities
- Technical milestones
- Dependencies and prerequisites

### 3. **PERFORMANCE-GUIDE.md**

Deep dive into performance optimization:

- High-performance data structures usage
- Memory management strategies
- Generated code optimizations
- Benchmarking methodology
- Performance monitoring integration
- Key performance principles

### 4. **API-REFERENCE.md**

Comprehensive API documentation:

- Attribute definitions and usage
- Type system mappings
- Extension points
- Code examples for all features
- Migration patterns from other libraries

### 5. **PATTERNS-CATALOG.md**

Design patterns and their implementation:

- Template Method for code generation
- Strategy for query execution
- Registry for type resolution
- DataLoader implementation
- Why these patterns work with source generators

### 6. **FEDERATION-GUIDE.md**

Federation-specific documentation:

- Build-time federation architecture
- Service client generation
- Query planning strategies
- Multi-service coordination
- Your specific microservices use case

### 7. **DEVELOPER-EXPERIENCE.md**

DX features and implementation:

- Compile-time validation
- Hot reload support
- Error message design
- Debugging strategies
- IntelliSense integration

### 8. **BENCHMARKS.md**

Performance comparison documentation:

- Benchmark methodology
- Comparison with HotChocolate
- Memory usage analysis
- Cold start performance
- Real-world scenarios

### 9. **MIGRATION-GUIDE.md**

Help users migrate from other libraries:

- From HotChocolate
- From GraphQL for .NET
- Common patterns mapping
- Gradual migration strategies

### 10. **COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md**

Market positioning and differentiation:

- Feature comparison matrix
- Performance comparisons
- Use case analysis
- Market segments
- Differentiation factors

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Each document has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Easier Navigation** - Developers can find exactly what they need
3. **Maintainability** - Updates are localized to specific documents
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Users can dive as deep as they need
5. **Team Collaboration** - Different team members can own different docs

## Document Relationships

```
PRD.md (What & Why)
  ├── COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS.md (Market Context)
  └── IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md (Development Plan)
      └── TDD.md (How - Technical Design)
          ├── ADR/* (Key Decisions)
          ├── PATTERNS-CATALOG.md (Design Patterns)
          ├── PERFORMANCE-GUIDE.md (Optimization)
          └── API-REFERENCE.md (Public Interface)
              ├── DEVELOPER-EXPERIENCE.md (DX Features)
              ├── FEDERATION-GUIDE.md (Advanced Features)
              └── MIGRATION-GUIDE.md (Adoption Path)
```

## Next Steps

1. Create the ADR directory and start documenting key decisions
2. Extract implementation timeline into IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md
3. Move performance-specific content to PERFORMANCE-GUIDE.md
4. Create API-REFERENCE.md with all the code examples
5. Document patterns in PATTERNS-CATALOG.md

This structure will make your documentation more accessible and maintainable while preserving all the valuable insights from your original document.
