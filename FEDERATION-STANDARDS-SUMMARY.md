# GraphQL Federation Standards Summary

## Executive Summary

The GraphQL Foundation's Composite Schemas Specification represents a comprehensive standardization effort for GraphQL federation. Currently in Stage 0 (Preliminary), this specification provides a mature approach to distributed GraphQL architectures with emphasis on explicitness, collaboration, and performance optimization.

## Key Standards and Concepts

### Core Federation Principles

1. **Composable**: Source schemas designed as components of a larger system
2. **Collaborative**: Team-focused with early conflict detection
3. **Evolvable**: Client compatibility maintained while services evolve
4. **Explicitness**: Minimal inference, maximum clarity

### Directive System

The specification defines a comprehensive set of directives for federation:

- **`@key`**: Entity identification across schemas
- **`@lookup`**: Entity resolution mechanisms
- **`@shareable`**: Explicit field sharing between schemas
- **`@internal`**: Schema-local visibility
- **`@inaccessible`**: Global visibility control
- **`@require`**: Field dependencies from other schemas
- **`@provides`**: Optimization hints for field resolution
- **`@external`**: Recognition of fields from other schemas
- **`@override`**: Field migration between schemas
- **`@is`**: Semantic equivalence mapping (RFC proposal)

### Field Selection Syntax

The specification introduces sophisticated field selection capabilities:

- Simple field mapping: `"fieldName"`
- Nested field access: `"address.id"`
- Object reshaping: `"{ width, height }"`
- Complex path traversal: `"dimension.{ width, height }"`
- List handling: `"parts[id]"`

### Composition Process

Three-phase validation and composition:

1. **Validate Source Schemas**: Individual schema validation
2. **Merge Source Schemas**: Conflict resolution and type merging
3. **Validate Satisfiability**: Ensure all requirements can be met

## Implications for Stratify.GraphQL

### Architectural Alignment Opportunities

1. **Source Generator Integration**
   - Generate federation directives at compile-time
   - Validate schema composition during build
   - Create type-safe entity resolvers

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Leverage `@provides` for query optimization
   - Compile-time query plan generation
   - Zero-overhead federation abstractions

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Compile-time federation validation
   - Type-safe field selection syntax
   - Clear error messages during composition

### Key Differentiators vs Existing Solutions

| Feature | Composite Schemas Spec | Apollo Federation | Schema Stitching |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Standardization | GraphQL Foundation | Apollo-specific | Community-driven |
| Explicitness | High (minimal inference) | Medium | Low |
| Field Migration | Built-in `@override` | Manual process | Not supported |
| Visibility Control | `@internal` + `@inaccessible` | Private fields | Limited |
| Field Selection | Advanced syntax | Basic | Basic |
| Performance Hints | `@provides` directive | Query planning | Runtime resolution |

## Strategic Recommendations

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate)
1. Implement core directive attributes for source generators
2. Create compilation-time schema validation
3. Build entity resolution framework

### Phase 2: Standards Compliance
1. Implement field selection syntax parser
2. Add composition validation rules
3. Create distributed execution planner

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Query plan optimization with `@provides`
2. Field migration support
3. Advanced type merging capabilities

## Competitive Advantages for Stratify.GraphQL

1. **First-to-Market**: Early implementation of GraphQL Foundation standards
2. **Compile-Time Federation**: Unique source generator approach
3. **Zero-Runtime Overhead**: All federation logic compiled away
4. **Type Safety**: Full compile-time validation of federation rules
5. **Performance**: Optimized query plans generated at build time

## Technical Considerations

### Source Generator Enhancements Needed

1. **Directive Processing**: Parse and validate federation directives
2. **Schema Composition**: Merge multiple schema definitions
3. **Query Plan Generation**: Create optimized execution plans
4. **Type Resolution**: Generate entity resolver code

### API Design Considerations

```csharp
// Example: Entity with federation support
[GraphQLType]
[Key("id")]
[Key("sku")]
public class Product
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Sku { get; set; }
    
    [Shareable]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    
    [External]
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

// Example: Lookup resolver
[Lookup]
public static Product GetProductById(string id, IProductService service)
    => service.GetById(id);
```

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority
- Core directive support (`@key`, `@lookup`, `@shareable`)
- Basic schema composition
- Entity resolution framework

### Medium Priority
- Advanced directives (`@require`, `@provides`, `@override`)
- Field selection syntax
- Query plan optimization

### Low Priority
- Complex type merging scenarios
- Migration tooling
- Federation debugging tools

## Conclusion

The GraphQL Composite Schemas Specification provides a robust foundation for implementing federation in Stratify.GraphQL. By leveraging source generators, we can create a unique implementation that offers compile-time safety, zero runtime overhead, and full standards compliance. This positions Stratify.GraphQL as the performance-focused, standards-compliant federation solution for .NET.
