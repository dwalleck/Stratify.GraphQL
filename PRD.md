# Stratify.GraphQL - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement

Current GraphQL implementations for .NET rely heavily on runtime reflection, resulting in performance overhead, complex debugging experiences, and incompatibility with ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. Developers are forced to choose between the feature-rich but "magical" HotChocolate and the more explicit but still reflection-dependent GraphQL for .NET.

### Solution Overview

Stratify.GraphQL is a high-performance, source generator-based GraphQL library for .NET that eliminates runtime reflection through compile-time code generation. It combines HotChocolate's developer experience with GraphQL for .NET's explicitness and predictability, positioning itself as the "Dapper of GraphQL" - focused on performance, simplicity, and transparency.

The key innovation is "compiling away" traditional design pattern abstractions - achieving the architectural benefits of patterns like Template Method, Strategy, and Command while generating direct, specialized code that eliminates runtime polymorphism and dynamic dispatch overhead.

### Success Metrics

- 50% faster cold start than HotChocolate
- 30% lower memory usage during execution
- Zero runtime reflection
- Full AOT compatibility
- Developer adoption rate of 1000+ GitHub stars within first year
- NuGet downloads reaching 10K/month within 18 months

### Timeline

- MVP Release: 6-8 weeks
- v1.0 Production Ready: 4-6 months
- Federation Support: 6-8 months
- Full Feature Parity (selected features): 12 months
