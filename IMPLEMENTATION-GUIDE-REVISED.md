# Stratify.GraphQL - Implementation Guide (Revised)

## Core Philosophy: Ruthless Prioritization

**Our Superpower**: Compile-time GraphQL with unmatched performance.

**What We're NOT**: Another full-featured GraphQL library trying to do everything.

## Revised Development Phases

### Phase 1: Performance-First MVP (8 weeks)

**Single Goal**: Prove 50% faster cold start with basic queries

#### Weeks 1-2: Source Generator Core
- [ ] Minimal source generator setup
- [ ] `[GraphQLObject]` and `[GraphQLField]` only
- [ ] Generate static resolvers for properties only
- [ ] **NO**: Custom scalars, interfaces, unions, enums

#### Weeks 3-4: Query Execution
- [ ] GraphQLParser integration (queries only)
- [ ] Direct field resolution (no abstraction layers)
- [ ] Minimal error handling
- [ ] **NO**: Mutations, subscriptions, fragments, variables

#### Weeks 5-6: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Frozen collections for field lookup
- [ ] Zero-allocation JSON writing
- [ ] Benchmark against HotChocolate
- [ ] **MUST ACHIEVE**: 50% faster cold start or pivot

#### Weeks 7-8: Minimal Viable Product
- [ ] ASP.NET Core integration (minimal)
- [ ] One impressive demo (readonly API)
- [ ] Performance documentation
- [ ] **NO**: Developer tools, playground, introspection

**MVP Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 50% faster cold start achieved
- ✅ Zero reflection in generated code
- ✅ One compelling benchmark
- ❌ Everything else can wait

### Phase 2: Production Essentials (8 weeks)

**Goal**: Minimum features for real-world use

#### Weeks 9-10: Mutations
- [ ] Mutation support (basic)
- [ ] Input types (simple only)
- [ ] **NO**: Complex input types, file uploads

#### Weeks 11-12: Service Integration
- [ ] Dependency injection
- [ ] Async field resolvers
- [ ] Basic DataLoader pattern
- [ ] **NO**: Advanced caching, distributed cache

#### Weeks 13-14: Type System Essentials
- [ ] Nullable types
- [ ] List types
- [ ] Enum support
- [ ] **NO**: Interfaces, unions, custom directives

#### Weeks 15-16: Production Hardening
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Basic authorization
- [ ] Introspection (minimal)
- [ ] **NO**: Hot reload, schema stitching

**Production Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Can build a real API
- ✅ Performance lead maintained
- ✅ 3 pilot customers
- ❌ Feature parity not required

### Phase 3: Market Differentiation (12 weeks)

**Goal**: Own the high-performance niche

#### Weeks 17-20: AOT Excellence
- [ ] Full AOT compatibility testing
- [ ] AOT-specific optimizations
- [ ] Blazor WASM showcase
- [ ] Mobile app demonstration

#### Weeks 21-24: Performance Leadership
- [ ] Advanced query planning
- [ ] Compile-time query optimization
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive benchmarks

#### Weeks 25-28: Strategic Features
- [ ] Choose ONE:
  - Basic federation (if customer demand)
  - Subscriptions (if customer demand)
  - Advanced type system (if blocking adoption)

**Differentiation Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Clear performance leadership
- ✅ AOT story compelling
- ✅ 10+ production deployments
- ✅ Recognized as "the fast one"

## What We're Explicitly NOT Doing

### Year 1 - Not Attempting
- ❌ Full GraphQL spec compliance
- ❌ Feature parity with HotChocolate
- ❌ Complex federation scenarios
- ❌ Schema-first development
- ❌ Developer tooling suite
- ❌ Multi-language support

### Forever - Not Our Mission
- ❌ Being all things to all people
- ❌ Runtime schema modification
- ❌ JavaScript/TypeScript generation
- ❌ GraphQL subscriptions over multiple transports

## Technical Decisions - Simplified

### Architecture
```csharp
// This is ALL we need for MVP
[GraphQLObject]
public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

// Generate this - no abstractions
public static class ProductResolver
{
    public static void Resolve(Product product, IResponseWriter writer)
    {
        writer.WriteStartObject();
        writer.WriteProperty("id", product.Id);
        writer.WriteProperty("name", product.Name);
        writer.WriteProperty("price", product.Price);
        writer.WriteEndObject();
    }
}
```

### What Gets Cut
- **Elegant abstractions** → Direct code generation
- **Flexible architecture** → Hardcoded fast paths
- **Extension points** → Sealed classes
- **Plugin system** → Not needed
- **Perfect error messages** → Good enough errors

## Milestone Redefinition

### Milestone 1: "Proof of Performance" (Week 6)
- Single benchmark showing 50% improvement
- Decision point: Continue or pivot

### Milestone 2: "First Customer" (Week 16)
- One production deployment
- Decision point: Which features actually matter

### Milestone 3: "Market Position" (Week 28)
- Known as "the fast GraphQL"
- Decision point: Expand or stay focused

## Risk Management - Simplified

### Only Three Risks Matter

1. **Performance targets not met** → Pivot or stop
2. **Too complex to use** → Simplify ruthlessly
3. **No market demand** → Find the niche or stop

### Everything Else is Noise
- Don't worry about full spec compliance
- Don't worry about missing features
- Don't worry about competitor features
- Worry ONLY about: Fast, Simple, Reliable

## Success Metrics - Focused

### The ONLY Metrics That Matter

**Technical**:
- Cold start: 50% faster ✓/✗
- Memory usage: 30% less ✓/✗
- AOT compatible: Yes/No

**Business**:
- Week 16: 1 production user
- Week 28: 10 production users
- Week 40: 50 production users

**Not Measuring**:
- GitHub stars
- Feature completeness
- Developer satisfaction surveys
- Conference talks

## Communication Strategy

### What We Say
- "Fastest GraphQL for .NET"
- "AOT-compatible GraphQL"
- "Zero-reflection GraphQL"

### What We DON'T Say
- "Full-featured"
- "GraphQL made easy"
- "Enterprise-ready" (until we are)
- "Replacement for X"

## Decision Framework

Every decision must pass this test:

1. **Does it make it faster?** → Consider
2. **Does it make it simpler?** → Consider
3. **Is a customer blocked without it?** → Consider
4. **Everything else** → NO

## Next Steps - Week 1

1. Delete unnecessary code
2. Set up benchmarking project
3. Create simplest possible generator
4. Measure baseline performance
5. Generate first resolver

**Remember**: We can always add features. We can never add performance.
