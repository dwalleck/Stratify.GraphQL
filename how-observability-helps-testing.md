My lovely Twitter peeps directed me to the works of [Abby Bangser](https://twitter.com/a_bangser), who shares similar views in her [O11ycast Episode](https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/o11ycast/ep-16-observability-and-test-engineers-with-abby-bangser-of-moo). She states that testers can use Observability to their advantage by having access to _relevant and explorable data_. As Parveen realized in her own explorations, this gives testers the ability to dig into the root cause of a bug, which is helpful for filing detailed bug reports to developers. But wait…there’s more! If a test engineer identifies a problem and isn’t able to track it down in the Observability back-end, it means that the telemetry data emitted by the application is lacking. That is, it shows that the code hasn’t been instrumented well enough, because it’s not exposing data that’s useful to us for troubleshooting!
