## Key Insights Captured

1. **Performance Focus**: Every document emphasizes the 50% faster cold start and 30% less memory usage goals
2. **Source Generator Innovation**: The unique approach of "compiling away" abstractions is well-documented
3. **Trade-offs Acknowledged**: Clear documentation of what features are sacrificed for performance
4. **Practical Roadmap**: Detailed implementation plan with realistic timelines
5. **Market Positioning**: Clear "Dapper of GraphQL" positioning throughout

## Next Steps

1. Create the remaining 5 documents as outlined above
2. Begin MVP implementation following the IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md
3. Set up repository structure as defined
4. Create initial source generator project
5. Start building community around the project
